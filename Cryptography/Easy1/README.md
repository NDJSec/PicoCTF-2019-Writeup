## Description
The one time pad can be cryptographically secure, but not when you know the key. Can you solve this? We've given you the encrypted flag, key, and a table to help UFJKXQZQUNB with the key of SOLVECRYPTO. Can you use this [table](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/static/30d4405c34cf6490b082e6cf8f56ac56/table.txt) to solve it?.

## Solution
This is a Vigenere cipher so you can use this [site](https://cryptii.com/pipes/vigenere-cipher) to decrypt it with the ciphertext and key provived.
