## Description
I wrote you a [song](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/static/24287456e17d7ee3a35147517fcb9305/lyrics.txt). Put it in the picoCTF{} flag format

## Solution
The song is using a programming language called rockstar

You can use this [link](https://codewithrockstar.com/online) to compile and run it

From there you will get numbers for output and you can use python to convert them to the flag

To see method for python take a look at the Solution Script.
