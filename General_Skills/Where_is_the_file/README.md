## Description
I've used a super secret mind trick to hide this file. Maybe something lies in /problems/where-is-the-file_4_f26b413d005c16c61f127740ab242b35.

## Solution
To solve this you need to cat the file 

First, you will need to cd to the challenge directory on the shell sever

To find the file you can use **ls -la** to see all files 

There you will see .cant_see_me 

You can cat the file and get the flag
