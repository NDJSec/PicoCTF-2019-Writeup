## Description
I wrote you another [song](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/static/0690cdfc040e177175b2822f690ec4e0/lyrics.txt). Put the flag in the picoCTF{} flag format

## Solution
You can use [this site](https://codewithrockstar.com/online) to convert the file into workable numbers
However, first you must remove these lines

to get rid of the need for input
 

You could also google "42 in binary" and you will get "0b101010" remove the 0b and that's your flag.
