## Points

## Description
Can you find the flag in file? This would be really tedious to look through manually, something tells me there is a better way. You can also find the file in /problems/first-grep_3_2e09f586a51352180a37e25913f5e5d9 on the shell server.

## Solution
You can log into the Shell and cd to the directory /problems/first-grep_3_2e09f586a51352180a37e25913f5e5d9

Run cat file | grep -i pico

To get the flag
